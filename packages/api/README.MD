### To-dos

1. Add persistence with mongo db
2. Include mongo db as third container in docker compose
3. Figure out how to add already-made db to mongo db image
4. Add gql mutation to accompany form on client
5. Split resolvers, schema, server into separate files for separation of concerns
6. Research 'makeExecutableSchema' as alternative for kick-starting gql service
7. Go from there!
