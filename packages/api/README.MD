API Design:
apollo server complete with:
server initialization,
schema,
resolvers that hit up database (I would do axios to other
gql service but Im not sure if theres a free one, so we'll just
use a database of my design for persistence)

Goal:
-get reps on well-defined schema and resolvers
-tying together gql + database functionality in resolvers for persistence of data
